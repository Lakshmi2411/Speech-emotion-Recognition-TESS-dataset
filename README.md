# Speech-emotion-Recognition-TESS-dataset
Voice-based emotion recognition involves analyzing speech signals to identify the underlying emotional states of the speaker. There are several types of plots that can be used to visualize and understand the emotional characteristics of speech data. Here are some common plots used in voice-based emotion recognition:

Waveform Plot: The waveform plot represents the amplitude of the audio signal over time. It provides a basic visualization of the raw audio and how it varies with time. Emotion-related features such as pitch, loudness, and speaking rate can be observed from the waveform plot.

Spectrogram: A spectrogram is a 2D representation of the frequency content of an audio signal over time. It shows how the frequency components change as the audio progresses. Spectrograms can reveal information about the formants (vocal tract resonances) and pitch variations in speech, which can be related to emotional expressions.

Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) Plot: MFCCs are widely used features in speech processing. The MFCC plot visualizes the coefficients extracted from the audio signal, representing the power spectrum of the sound. MFCCs are commonly used for emotion recognition due to their effectiveness in capturing speech characteristics.

Pitch Contour Plot: The pitch contour plot shows the pitch of the speech signal over time. This plot helps in visualizing variations in pitch, which can be indicative of emotional changes or expressive speech patterns.

Emotion Class Distribution Plot: This plot shows the distribution of different emotion classes in the dataset. It helps to understand the class imbalance and may prompt the need for data balancing techniques.

Feature Scatter Plot: If you have extracted multiple features (e.g., MFCCs, pitch, energy) from the audio, you can create scatter plots to visualize the distribution of these features for different emotions. This allows you to see how well the features separate emotions.

Confusion Matrix: In the context of emotion classification, a confusion matrix shows the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. It helps evaluate the performance of the emotion classifier by showing which emotions are frequently misclassified
